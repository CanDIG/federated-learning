# Federated-Learning Documentation
The federated-learning repository is large and complex, and hence must be split into several parts, each of which have their own documentation sections.


## Experiments Documentation
- [`FL_experiments.md`](FL_experiments.md): Documents the `experiments` subdirectory and details the process for generating a new experiment.
- [`FL_experiments_structure.md`](FL_experiments_structure.md): Documents the `experiments/mock-experiment` subdirectory.

## Ingestion Documentation
- [`FL_ingestion.md`](FL_ingestion.md): Documents the `ingestion-scripts` subdirectory and details the data ingestion process.

## Orchestration Documentation
- [`FL_orchestration.md`](FL_orchestration.md): Documents the `orchestration-scripts` subdirectory.

## Services Documentation
- [`FL_services.md`](FL_services.md): Documents the `services` subdirectory and details the purpose of each subfolder within the subdirectory.
