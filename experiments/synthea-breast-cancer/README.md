# Synthea Breast Cancer Experiment
The team at [The MITRE Corporation](https://mitre.org) have created a population simulation tool called `Synthea`, which was leveraged by the [HL7](https://hl7.org) organization to create [synthetic patient mCODE datasets](https://confluence.hl7.org/display/COD/mCODE+Test+Data).

We are using the `Approx. 2,000 Patient Records with 10 Years of Medical History` breast cancer dataset, downloadable [here](http://hdx.mitre.org/downloads/mcode/mcode1_0_10yrs.zip). This synthetic dataset mostly contains patients with breast cancer, though some other cancers are also present. We have created multiple experimental setups to use this data to create and train models for use in federated, and non-federated contexts.
