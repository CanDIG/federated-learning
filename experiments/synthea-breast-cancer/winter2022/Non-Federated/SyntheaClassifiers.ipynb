    "We will carry out training and testing of a classifier using the Python scikit-learn module, using the pre-processed [Synthea Data](https://confluence.hl7.org/display/COD/mCODE+Test+Data) that we stored in a file called [SyntheaEDA](SyntheaEDA.csv), during our previous EDA analysis of the Synthea Data.\n",

    "From the results above, it is evident that the linear regression classifier we have built is quite good, given that its r2 score is about 0.89 and its mean squared error (MSE) is only about 0.085. Given that the closer r2 is to 1.0, the better and the closer MSE is to 0, the better, our model is quite accurate with its analysis. We notice that this trend is compunded when we look at the rounded regression and mse scores. We have used rounded results in addition to the regular results since linear regression generally works on continous data, whereas the classification task on hand works with discrete data and as such, to make the continous data from the predictions into discrete data, we round them. These new values for the r2 and the mse of 0.91 and 0.067 respectively display quite an accurate model and we will see later on that the model is quite respectable in its performance. However, at the end of the day, linear regression is best suited for continous data and not classification data, and as such, we choose not to use ot as our default classifier."

These scores depict the high precision and accuracy of the model, as well as its tendency not to produce very many false positives and negatives, which is corroborated by the confusion matrix. The model, as seen with the confusion matrix underpredicted the stage of cancer only once, and overpredicted six times, and even then, the predicted stage only ever deviated from the actual stage by one level.

Interestingly, it seems like the number of radiation therapies, whether or not the cancer improved and the number of medications have no bearing on the stage which is not necessarily something that one would expect in real life.

    "The Gaussian Naive Bayes algorithm is generally used for continous data as it starts by assuming [normally distributed, independent features](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Naive_Bayes_classifier). We know that our data is not normally distributed as its not continous (eg. primary tumours can range between the integers 0 and 4), and hence this model wouldn't be our best assumption. Yet looking at the accuracy, the Macro F1 score and the MCC Scores paint a different picture, with values of 0.9587, 0.9433 and 0.9010 respectively. These highlight the precise and accurate results determined by the classifier, despite much of the input data not being continous. The model also has a tendency to overpreddict vs underpredict, with 18 overpredictions to 0 underpredictions. This could be quite useful in ensuring that the cancers are looked at carefully and not treated lightly. However, overprediction also comes with costs, particularly pyschological costs and time costs, such as if a Stage 1 patient is misidentified as a Stage 3 patient. \n",

    "A similar problem to the Multinomial NB Classifier emerges when dealing with the Bernoulli NB Classifier. While the Bernoulli NB Classifier isn't used for frequency counts, it is used when the data is of binary values and when the input data is not as such, the classifier fits the data into binary values. Given this, it is evident why the model has quite low accuracy, macro f1 and mcc and why it has many overpredictions and underpredictions - the data is not of the specified type. So let's try one-hot encoding the data to try using the Bernoulli/Multinomial NB classifiers, since this would turn all of the inputs into binary/freq values, that the classifiers could then work with. For this we must drop the age category since it is inherently continous versus the other labels which are discrete.\n",

It also performs well under many samples of the dataset, and isn't accurate purely due to overfitting.

Perhaps our model was overfitting to the data too much after we adjusted its parameters to fit the results better. The model, as can be seen from the confusion matrix, has a tendency to both overpredict and underpredict, especially for higher stages. Therefore, we disregard this LDA-reduced RF Classifier from being in contention for our model of choice."

    "#### Conclusions\n",
    "\n",
    "From the results of the expirimentation above, while we have many models that stand out, the best of the bunch seem to be the Decision Tree Classifier, One-Hot Encoded Multinomial Classifier and the Random Forest Classifier without LDA. All 3 had such similar scores and predictions that they were virtually identical. In fact, the greatest mismatch between the predictions of the classifiers was that of one model that had underpredicted a single value compared to the others. Clearly, 1 result out of 1074 is not something that should weight so heavily in the grand scheme of things. In fact, given how close the models are, we now turn to external factors to determine our model of choice. \n",
    "\n",
    "We first remove the Multinomial Naive Bayes classifier from contention given that, while it performs quite accurately, the setup work required to create it and thus retrain it with any new information has an oppurtunity cost much greater than any of the other models. One-Hot Encoding takes a significant portion of time to set up, and say we got some training data that also included genomics data that we now want to add. This process would be significantly more lengthy with the multinomial naive bayes classifier given that we would have to one-hot encode it. While the Multinomial NB does have its benefits, for our purposes, the other classifiers fit much better.\n",
    "\n",
    "Out of our final two, we have selected the decision tree model as our model of choice. This is because, given that both models have similar accuracy and precision, the decision tree model is much easier to visualize and explain than the random forest classifier. While random forests are made up of decision trees, they use many of them and as such, it [gets hard to visualize](https://www.analyticsvidhya.com/blog/2020/05/decision-tree-vs-random-forest-algorithm/) and interpret the process the model undergoes. This is obviously not the case with a simple decision tree, which as we depicted above, had a visual model ready to view very quickly. This will be of significant importance in a setting like cancer research where the findings from the model may need to be communicated back to experts, which is much easier with a simple decision tree. Additionally, Random Forests take more time and resources to train and if we want to improve our predictions with data, we would be committing more if we went with random forests over decision trees. \n",
    "\n",
    "Hence we've selected the **Decision Tree Classifier** as our model of choice for this task. In training and testing, it performed quite well with quite high accuracy in low training time. It also is quite visualizable which makes it quite handy for communicating the results produced."
